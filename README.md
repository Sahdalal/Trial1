README for Stock Prediction Project Using Neural Networks
Project Overview
This project predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model is trained on historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance and uses features like daily returns and volatility to enhance prediction accuracy. The project is implemented in Python and leverages libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Key Features
Data Collection: Downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Displays statistical summaries.
Visualizes trends in closing prices.
Shows correlations between features using a heatmap.
Feature Engineering:
Adds daily returns and volatility to the dataset.
Data Preprocessing:
Scales features using Min-Max scaling.
Creates sequences for LSTM input.
LSTM Model Building and Training:
Implements a multi-layer LSTM for time series prediction.
Visualizes training and validation losses.
Model Evaluation:
Calculates metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
Compares actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Model Saving:
Saves the trained model in HDF5 format.


Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries:

Python 3.x
yfinance
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Install the libraries using:
bash


Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt


How to Use
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Set the stock symbol and date range in the script:
python


Copy code
STOCK_SYMBOL = "SPY"
START_DATE = "2015-01-01"
END_DATE = "2024-12-09"


Run the script:
bash


Copy code
python main.py
The script will:
Download and process stock data.
Train an LSTM model on the data.
Evaluate the model and display metrics.
Save the trained model to the models directory.


File Structure
main.py: Main script containing all functionalities (data collection, EDA, model training, etc.).
models/: Directory where the trained model will be saved.
requirements.txt: Contains the list of required libraries.


Customization
Modify hyperparameters (sequence length, LSTM units, learning rate, etc.) in the script:
python
Copy code
SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 50
LSTM_UNITS = 64
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001
EPOCHS = 20
BATCH_SIZE = 32



Results
The script will output metrics and a plot comparing actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Example output metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.02
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.15
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 5.23%
Future Enhancements
Add more technical indicators.
Experiment with different neural network architectures.
Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
Enjoy predicting stock prices! ðŸš€
